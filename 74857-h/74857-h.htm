<p>This little book invites you to read it
at a single sitting. If read later, a section
at a time, in the light of the whole
story, it will give you a better account
of itself. It is, I frankly acknowledge,
written out of emotion. It does not
therefore, I fear, contain all the words
it implies—half the time falling into
symbols and incidents to force a meaning;
half the time taking for granted
that you do not care to open or close
every side gate along the way.</p>

<p>The view of a layman, as this easily
betrays itself to be, may prove something
of a shock to the rank and file of
the clergy; but it will serve, at least, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>show that a section of laymen take religion
more seriously after all than they
do economics, which forms their daily
adventure. Deep in our hearts, many
of us know that business is the great
masculine sport of the age; and in comparison,
the rôle of the priest and pastor
and the function of the church lie in
the far different realm of the heroic.
If I seem in this essay to expect too
much of the church and too much
of the preacher, my only apology
is my inability to read into the Four
Gospels, that stand on my desk along
with the other tools of life and work, a
philosophy of ease or of complacent
<i>laissez faire</i>.</p>

<p>Although a confirmed lover of the
country, the farm, the farmer and his
children, I am none the less a firm believer
in the city—its necessity, function,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>and destiny. Rural social welfare,
as I see it, is of utmost concern to
the American city. This is why empty
churches along the countryside bring
tragedy to city and country alike. This
is why ecclesiastical statesmen should go
to the country and see with their own
eyes the havoc wrought upon the farmer’s
family by competitive religion
among Protestants.</p>

<p>And this is all the little book sets out
to do—to take everybody to the rural
communities with wide-open eyes, to see
the empty churches, the children without
God, the farm tenants without religion,
the parsons on the run for the city,
and the beginnings of a new type of
rural church.</p>

<p>I wish gratefully to acknowledge my
indebtedness in this essay to the staff of
the Institute of Social and Religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>Research, New York City, upon whose
authoritative statements I have much
relied. To the Curtis Publishing Company,
Philadelphia, I desire to express
appreciation for their kindness in allowing
me to reproduce here materials
which have appeared in “The Country
Gentleman” during the past year.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>


<p>Recently, in a cross-roads
country church, a minister of the
Gospel, underpaid, somewhat shabby,
but eager and inspired, a man with a
message to give, stood before his congregation
to present that message. The
flame of inspiration in his haggard
young face flickered and died as he
looked down at the scanty congregation
assembled before him to hear the
Word of God. At a glance he counted
his handful of hearers. Six.</p>

<p>Through a window on one side of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>the little church, he could see two other
meeting-houses nestling in the curve of
the road. Through a window on the
other side, he looked out at a third—four
country churches of four Christian
denominations, almost identical in doctrine,
there within two stone’s-throws
of one another.</p>

<p>In three of these churches, including
his own, he knew that the members of
the congregation might be counted
upon the fingers of each pastor’s two
hands. The third church was closed
that day; its flock could afford only an
occasional shepherd.</p>

<p>In all four of those churches put together,
not one fair-sized congregation.
In all four, not one pastor paid a salary
large enough to enable him to live on his
income as a minister. In all four, men
and women taxed by religion beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>their ability to pay, yet unable to support
their church without outside aid.</p>


<p><i>Jealous Denominations</i></p>

<p>The young minister thought with pain
of other sections of the country
through which he had traveled all day
without seeing one church of any denomination.
He knew that an appalling
percentage of farm communities
throughout the United States were entirely
without churches, that thousands
of children, hundreds of their elders, had
never listened to the preaching of the
Gospel. Yet here there were four
churches at the country cross-roads!</p>

<p>That afternoon that young pastor
wrote me a letter, wrote it in pain and
bitterness, but also in hope, in earnest
desire to get the facts before the
nation:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>I saw in the paper the other day some
mention of the chief rural problems of the
United States. May I call your attention
to what ministers in every country district
regard as the stiffest problem known to them
and to their people? I refer to the problem
of the competitive religion, which affects not
only pastors, but the entire rural population,
financially and spiritually, as well.
The spiritual rivalry set in motion by well-meaning
home-mission boards and zealous
and jealous denominations is undermining
the present and the future welfare of the
country church by ignoring the law of
supply and demand. If you can suggest
any solution for this great problem, we shall
all be grateful.</p>
</div>

<p>The case was in no way overstated
by this young man. It is quite true
that there are few, if any, greater rural
problems to-day than the problem of
the country church. It is undeniable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>that any honest student of conditions
in rural churches is confronted by staggering
and depressing statistics of
overchurching and underattendance
in some sections, and of entire lack of
attendance due to no churching at all
in others.</p>

<p>Any map that showed the present
rural church distribution of the
United States would be alarmingly
reminiscent of a map of a country with
large areas of sterile famine-land.
Nine persons out of every hundred in
rural America can not get to church because
there is no church for them to
attend. This means that one seventh
of all the rural communities of the
United States are entirely without
Protestant churches. Pathetic reports
of the spiritual hunger of these land dwellers,
living in a Christian nation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>yet entirely shut off from Christian
organization of every kind, come from
these communities.</p>

<p>“No Protestant sermon has ever
been preached in this locality,” is one
S O S sent out from a neighborhood
of two hundred persons. “Not a child
in this district has ever attended
Sunday-school,” deprecates another
community of approximately the same
size. “This back-to-the-land movement
is fine, but why should loyal
land dwellers have to condemn their
children to heathenry?” demands a
distracted mother, in a remote section of
a Western State. “My children are
growing up to be little savages, as far
as religion is concerned. They have
never been inside a church in their lives,
and they don’t know what Sunday-school
means.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>Only one fifth of the rural population
goes to church.</p>

<p>Two-fifths of the rural churches of
the country are standing still or losing
ground.</p>

<p>A quarter of all rural churches
have no Sunday-school.</p>

<p>One fifth of all rural churches are
kept alive by home-mission aid. Of
these subsidized churches, a large
number are in active competition
with churches of very similar doctrines.</p>

<p>Seven out of every ten rural
churches have only a fraction of a
pastor apiece.</p>

<p>One third of all rural pastors receive
so low a salary that they can
live only by working at some other
occupation.</p>

<p>One half of the rural churches of
the country make an annual gain in
membership of as much as 10 per
cent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<p>In striking contrast to this churchless
seventh of the country, are the
other six sevenths of rural America,
many of them so overchurched that
they are crying out for relief from the
burdens the churches are laying upon
them. There are ten times as many
churches for every thousand persons in
some of the rural districts of the
United States as there are in New
York City. Yet the percentage of
attendance for every thousand persons
is slightly lower in these rural sections
than it is even in New York. Obviously,
such a showing indicates a
startling lack of system in the distribution
of rural churches, a woeful waste
of the religious potentialities of the
country.</p>

<p>Recently, a thorough survey of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>rural church problem of the United
States was made for the first time in
the history of the country, under the
direction of H. N. Morse and Edmund
de S. Brunner, of the Institute of
Social and Religious Research, of New
York. Some of the statistics obtained
by them are presented in the foregoing
paragraphs.</p>

<p>These facts, of course, offer a severe
shock to those who have the little white
church of the countryside enshrined in
memory along with the little red school-house.
We have fallen into the rut of
taking it for granted that our country
churches not only keep pace with the
best religious life of the nation, but even
stay a step or two in advance, if not
in theology, at least in interest in godly
things and in piety. We have come to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>think of country folk as the true
church-goers of the United States. To
this sentimental point of view the facts
stated offer a true affront.</p>


<p><i>Fewer Church-goers</i></p>

<p>There are to-day approximately
101,000 rural churches in the United
States. A long time ago, when there
were only a hundred such churches,
virtually the entire country population
attended them. Some time later, when
there were a thousand churches of the
kind, the average of attendance was
still exceedingly high. But of recent
years the percentage of rural church-goers
has almost seemed to be in an
inverse ratio to the increase in churches.
One out of every five is not a showing
that would have brought joy to the
Puritan Fathers. What is the reason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>for this precarious situation in the
rural churches of our nation? Does it
indicate that our country population
is made up of a less God-fearing folk
than in former years? Does it demonstrate
that religion is less near to the
hearts of the farm workers of the
United States than is true of its city
dwellers? Or are these conditions the
logical outgrowth of a faulty system,
the inevitable result of a church distribution
spiritually and economically
unsound?</p>

<p>More than one thing must be taken
into consideration in any fair-minded
attempt to answer these questions.
For instance, there is the fact that during
the past few years the number of
tenant-farmers in the United States
has steadily increased, until now
thirty-eight per cent. of the farms are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>tenant operated, most often on the basis
of the one-year lease. Any fact that
tends to make the farmer more or less
a transient in the community naturally
deters him from forming social
or religious relationships.</p>

<p>Another reason frequently given for
the low average of rural church attendance
is that so high a percentage—nearly
30 per cent.—of the nation’s
land workers are new Americans, the
foreign-born, or the children of the
foreign-born. There are States, such
as North Dakota, where nearly every
other farmer belongs to other than
American nativity, and whole sections
of the country, as in the Middle West,
where foreigners are in excess of two
fifths of the population. It is estimated
that at the present time more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>than fifty per cent. of these people
are unministered to by any church,
Catholic or Protestant. Where anything
like an earnest and comprehensive
attempt has been made by churches
to be of aid to them, as among the
Mexicans of California, it has been
marked by astonishing results. Then
why have the churches done practically
nothing for the foreign-born in rural
sections? If the new American can
make good on the land, is it too much
to ask the church to make good with the
new American?</p>

<p>When I hear it said that no one is
really interested in religion any more,
I cannot help thinking of an elderly
Yankee farmer in the State of Vermont,
one J. C. Coolidge, father of
our President, a man who talks little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>about religion, but who for years has
given virtually all his leisure time, and
a considerable slice of time not leisure at
all, to keeping alive the little white
church near his farm at Plymouth
Notch. He hauls the wood from his
own land that the congregation of that
little church may listen in comfort to
the Word of God; he even, I am told,
does the janitor work himself, since
the church has no funds for a janitor.
There is nothing especially remarkable
in this. There are thousands of such
men all over our country, men to whom
the church is a thing to make sacrifices
for, to keep alive at whatever
cost.</p>

<p>But in many districts it really seems
that the fewer churches a county is
able to afford, the more it is apt to
have. Out of the 211 churches financially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>aided by home-missions societies
in several counties where intensive
studies were made by the Institute of
Social and Religious Research, I am
told that it was found that 149 of these
churches could have been dispensed
with without essential loss to anyone.
All but thirty-four were competitive.</p>


<p><i>Untrained Country Preachers</i></p>

<p>Another grave charge is made against
the church to-day in our country districts.
Farmers feel that they are
neglected by the ministers of their
churches.</p>

<p>It is also charged that many rural
pastors lack both adequate training
and ability for their high calling. The
real marvel is that so many of these
men are of the high type they are.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>
<p>It has to be admitted that there is
ground for the charge of incompetency
among some of the rural pastors of
the United States. These men, it is
true, are most inadequately prepared
for their work. How are they to afford
more training for a calling which
will never pay them any returns upon
it? That these men can develop into
able preachers has been demonstrated
by those who have had the opportunity
to complete their courses in the summer
school for ministers, inaugurated,
I believe, by the Presbyterian Board
and now conducted by several denominations.
But most of them do not
have this chance.</p>

<p>It is competitive religion that is
largely responsible for these two dangerous
factors in rural religious life—the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>non-resident pastor, too occupied
to be a true spiritual shepherd; and the
incompetent pastor, too incapable to
be a leader of his people.</p>

<p>But Christianity will not vanish
from our country districts. Nowhere
is there better soil for the seeds of true
religion than in the sturdy soul of
rural America.</p>

<p>It is not so much <i>isms</i> or <i>ologies</i>
that the rural population wants as it
is religious facilities for themselves and
for their children. Some time ago,
when a study of fifteen Western States
was made by the Home Mission
Council, it mentioned the following
fact:</p>

<p>“The general feeling manifested by
the returns shows little care for denominationalism.
What these people want
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>is some one to present Bible facts in an
acceptable manner.”</p>


<p><i>The Call Can Be Met</i></p>

<p>This is as true to-day as it was when
it was written ten years ago. Sunday-schools
for their children; an adequate
number of churches, not fewer than
will meet their needs or more than they
can support; usable churches, open the
year round, with able ministers in
charge—these are the things the population
of our rural districts wants.</p>

<p>How are they to get them? By the
installation of system into the religious
life of the country sections. There
are enough churches in the United
States to-day, if they were distributed
on the basis of a real need rather than
on the grounds of competitive religion,
to reach the remotest sections of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>country. The money now expended
on nonproductive churches would purchase
real vitality for essential churches
all through rural America.</p>

</p>


<p>Regular men and women long
for children as they long for good
luck, long life, and sweet happiness.
But they do not want just children,
any kind whatever so that they be
children. No indeed! It is always
a whole, healthy child, a bright, intelligent
child, a loving, obedient child, a
beautiful, virtuous child, that lives
warm in their dreams. And a child
with such characteristics costs more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>than many men and women can pay;
for a well-bred child, like a well-bred
colt, is the product of many favoring
tides of good fortune.</p>


<p><i>Farms, The Place of Children</i></p>

<p>So it is that the Johns and Marys who
leave the farm and its open spaces for
city life give up having children of
their own,—often without knowing
it when they leave the country, to
be sure,—and find themselves later
doomed to work out human contentment
in some other way; for the high
cost of city space, of just sufficient
elbow-room for a child to grow in and
acquire the human characteristics desired,
is almost as prohibitive as if a
law were on the statute-books forbidding
the rearing of children in city
blocks. While my critic is biting his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>thumb at this “exaggeration,” gravely
asserting that he knows there are many
families of children in our American
cities, I have caught his eye and will
hold it long enough to tell him a thing
disclosed by the last United States
Census report, viz., among the thirty
millions of farm people, there are
4,000,000 more children under twenty-one
years of age than there are among
any thirty millions of city people.
And this bald fact virtually declares
the truth I am uttering—that the
country contains the children of the
nation, that the farm is the natural
rearing-ground of well-bred children,
and that the city core—the stamping-ground
of business and adults—abhors
children as “nature abhors a vacuum.”</p>

<p>My story will not reach home, however,
unless one pauses a moment to let
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>this census fact soak in. Here is an
excess of children living on our farms
that would make a small nation,—bigger
than Switzerland, bigger than
Chili, than Norway, than famous little
agricultural Denmark.</p>


<p><i>Cities Get Youth from Farms</i></p>

<p>And what will become of this excess
of children? What else than this?
The farms will manage to feed them,
clothe them, educate them until they
come of age, when, possessed of the
strong right arm, they will turn their
backs on the farm and farming, and
go to recruit the nerve-fagged industry
of cities.</p>

<p>The farms feed industry, professional
service, and city life with muscle,
intellect, and imagination. This is
the romance, and there is not a word in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>it of wheat, corn, cotton, or cattle.
This every-day function of the farm,
often spoken of lightly, almost as if
it were a poetic fiction, is the solid stratum
of fact upon which the plot of my
story rests. The annual editorial
blast, “Keep the boy on the farm,”
never concerns this slowly moving
stream of young adults cityward, for
these are a surplus, an excess. And
they must go, as sure as fate. A legion
of editorials could not dam back this
flow.</p>

<p>We are not without some definite
information, moreover, as to how this
surplus of farm population works its
way to the cities of the nation; for a
unique study has been made by the
United States Department of Agriculture—of
the movement of 3000
young people from a thousand farms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>in one community—over a period of one
hundred years—a community where
(and this fits into my story) the God of
the Puritans has been known by the
children from the days of the first log
cabins. We know just which farms
sent their surplus crop of young folk
away. We know exactly where they
went in the United States. And,
furthermore, we know what vocations
they recruited, and what achievements
in these vocations they made. In a
nutshell, we know in some measure
what the contribution of human force
and influence was from these thousand
farms, farm by farm, to the upbuilding
of the cities of the nation. The unfolding
picture of this farm community’s
impact upon the nation’s life during
the century just passed is precisely
the thing many persons have looked for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>to put national meaning into the daily
disappearance from the farms of the
surplus of young adults which every
few years amounts to a strong small
nation poured into city industry.</p>

<p>I cannot pass this remarkable study
by without naming some of the men
who as “exportable surplus” left the old
farmstead to work out careers in cities.
I will name only those whom you know,
and know to honor. You remember
Governor George Peck of Wisconsin.
You knew him as the <i>Peck</i> of “Peck’s
Bad Boy.” Farm number 555 among
these thousand farms gave Governor
Peck to Wisconsin. Governor Reuben
Wood of Ohio came from farm number
119. Governor Cushman Davis,
of Minnesota, afterward United States
Senator, was the product of farm number
556, just as much as the wheat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>from that farm was a product and went
into national trade. Farm number 618
gave Charles Finney to American
Christendom and to Oberlin College
as its honored president. Farm number
701 raised Charles N. Crittenton,
gave him to the wholesale drug business
in New York City, in which he accumulated
wealth with which he put
into operation his ideal for friendless
girls. The Florence Crittenton Rescue
Homes for girls in seventy-two
cities of the United States tells his
story. One of the little hamlets in the
community produced Daniel Burnham,
America’s leading architect, at home
equally in Chicago, New York, or
Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>But these brighter lights of the exodus
do not by any means convey what
is perhaps after all the greater influence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>and might of the majority of
the human surplus who went forth and
found their places and played their
rôles as less widely known personalities
in enterprises of banking, manufacture,
teaching, or merchandizing, where
they helped weave the fabric of
America and its institutions as we
know them in every-day life.</p>

<p>The force of this plain story of the
human product of good farms, in a
community where God was known,
lies not in what might be considered the
exceptional character of the community,
but rather in the fact that the story
of this particular community of farms
is the story, in one respect or another,
of all American farm communities.
This study convinces both men of the
farms and men of the cities,—as it sets
their memories to work about the migrants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>from the land whom they have
known—that as the farming communities
wax or wane, so wax or wane the
cities and the nation.</p>


<p><i>Many Children Virtual Pagans</i></p>

<p>And here an unsuspected villain enters
my story. Do not laugh in your
sleeve when you discover that the villain
is a fact, merely a fact; but, by the by,
a very stubborn and blistering fact.
Of the fifteen millions of farm children—children
under twenty-one years
of age,—more than four millions are
virtual pagans, children without knowledge
of God. If, perchance, they
know the words to curse with, they do
not know the Word to live by. This
saddening fact is the solemn disclosure
of the recent study, already
mentioned, made by the Social and Religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>Institute of New York City.</p>

<p>A survey of 179 counties in the
United States, representatively selected,
enables the Institute with confidence
to assert that “1,600,000 farm
children live in communities where
there is no church or Sunday-school
of any denomination,” and “probably
2,750,000 more who do not go to any
Sunday-school, either because the
church to which their parents belong
does not have any, or because they do
not care to connect themselves with such
an organization.”</p>

<p>One does not get the real inwardness
of this fact until one appreciates that
these 1,600,000 of pagan children are
not scattered evenly, or more or less
evenly, among the other millions of
children who are in contact with the
Bible, but are in a great measure homed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>in bibleless, godless communities. The
nation might possibly assimilate a million
bibleless children if they were
brought up among several millions of
children who know the concepts of
religion; but absorbing godless children
in great numbers from whole godless
groups is a bird of a different
feather. What is still more disconcerting,
the trend, we are led to suppose,
is not from bad to better, but
from bad to worse.</p>

<p>“There is no national passion for
seeking out the godless community
and setting the Bible there,” we hear
on every hand.</p>

<p>“The promoters of Bible study are
too apologetic to business, to education,
to pleasure, even, and go not about
their tasks as those who have a commission
from the nation,” many say.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>
<p>But these bare statements fail, perhaps,
to get hold of us. We must have
particulars and the pulse of the thing.
And so I wish to take a page out
of my own experience and let you
read it.</p>


<p><i>Trapped in a Godless Community</i></p>

<p>My duties, a while back, took me into
the clover-bearing hills of a promising
county in a dairy State. I stayed the
night with a farmer’s family, enjoying
the hospitality and confidences of the
home. Never shall I forget two episodes
of the evening.</p>

<p>The milking was finally over—twelve
mighty good cows. I had been allowed
to milk three, taking the mother’s place
on her favorite milking-stool. Certain
cows were “tender” and responded
kindly to her gentler touch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>
<p>The house was on a side hill sloping
steeply to the road, and across the road
was a thinly timbered twenty-acre lot.
The warm milk had been poured into
ten-gallon cans and carried up to the
house, where stood, in a neat little
milk-house, a cream separator. When
all was ready, the separator began to
sing, the cream came trickling out, the
skim-milk poured into a ten-gallon
can, as the gaunt six-foot-three,
narrow-shouldered farmer turned the
crank. At the first whirring tune-up
of the separator, I hear a scurrying
of feet in the timber lot below, and
soon a regiment of hogs and pigs were
at the fence, standing with hind feet
in the long trough, front feet over the
top rail of the fence, black heads in a
row, beady little eyes peering up the
hill, open mouths giving vent to a long-drawn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>squeal of jubilant petition. As
the whir of the separator grew into a
liquid hum, the squealing chorus rose
to heaven, filling the valley, investing
the farm, like a piece of symbolism,
with the imperious demands of animals
and crops upon the total energies of
the family. Finally the last drop of
milk went through the separator.
Then the father put his hands to two
handles of two ten-gallon cans of skim-milk;
one son grasped the other handle
of one can; another son caught hold
of the handle of the second can; while
each son in his remaining hand held a
pail of the milk. Then they three,
with two cans and two brimming pails,
took up their stately march abreast
down the hill to the squealing chorus
at the trough. It looked for all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>world like some priestly ritual. The
milk was poured into the trough. The
pigs ceased to chant and began to
suck, guzzle, push, and grunt. So the
day’s work was over, and we sought
the house. Darkness fell over the hill
and valley and the filled pigs lay down
to sleep; while the farmer gathered his
family about him, took up his Bible
and read the Scriptures, even as did
the cotter, whom Burns, the farmer
Scot, made us know:</p>

<p>Conversation in the morning
brought out the fact that this hillside
home was virtually the only one, in
this clover community, struggling to
bring up its children in the knowledge
of God. No church, no Sunday-school,
no parochial school, no Bible
class. The gaunt father, gathering
emotion as he overheard his own story,
said:</p>

<p>“I have only one problem now. In
twelve years my cows and hogs have
paid for themselves, paid for my farm,
built my barn and house. The one
problem is not money any longer, but
it is my boys and girls. They are just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>now at the point where the home can
no longer hold them, and they will, I
fear, sink into the mire of this godless
community.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, ‘mire’?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, it is hard to put into words,”
he continued. “Perhaps this will give
you some idea: since I have been here,
now twelve years, not a wedding has
taken place anywhere hereabouts that
has not been forced. And this is not
the worst of it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you start a Sunday-school?”
I urged.</p>

<p>“Too late!” he sighed. “My children
are almost beyond me. I was, I
fear, too busy with my cows and pigs,
and the children just grew up before
I knew it.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?” I could not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>refrain from asking, more to myself
than to him, in my own perplexity, as
I tried to share in the problem.</p>

<p>“The only thing I can do,” said he,
as if the conversation had strengthened
a previous resolution half-heartedly
entertained, “is to yield to my wife’s
judgment; sell the farm, go to some
safe community where there is a
church, Sunday-school, and a high
school. We people here in this
community made our great mistake in
starting out wrong. We made a
religion of our pure-bred hogs and
cattle, and let our boys and girls go to
the dogs.”</p>

<p>This tale of children, who turned
out to have been unwittingly sidetracked
by cows and hogs, recalled my
own experience in breaking some new
land in the Skims at a period in my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>life when the doctor had said: “What
you need is to get close to the land.
Crawl around on the soil a year or two
and you will learn over again how to
sleep.”</p>

<p>Well, with my old horse The Cid
and a mail-order one-horse plow, I
went through the motions of plowing
that pine cut-over from which the pines
had been skimmed off like cream from
a milk-pan. Surveying the scratched
and torn field, somewhat bruised and
bleeding, I will declare it was, I said
to myself:</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look really plowed; but
it will be all right when I get it dragged.”</p>

<p>Then The Cid did his very best at
dragging. Dutifully—with an inner
chuckle, I am sure, at my green
expectations, for he was a seasoned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>old Skims horse himself—he plodded
along and over the field. At last I
stood sweating and weary, looking it
over, and was obliged to own up:</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look dragged; but it will
be all right when I get it cultivated.”</p>

<p>I went through the form of marking
and planting, and though I couldn’t
see the rows very well, I quieted my
discontent by saying to myself, “It will
be all right when I get it hoed.”</p>

<p>But when the corn came up, it was
accompanied by such a community of
weeds, briers, grass, and small bushes,
that I couldn’t cultivate because I
couldn’t see the corn.</p>

<p>After I had in much perplexity
stared at the cultivator and then at
the field, I looked that piece of work
square in the face and averred:</p>

<p>“If I ever plow again, I am not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>going to kid myself into thinking that
the cultivator will straighten out the
sins of the plow.”</p>

<p>This raw-boned farmer and his wife,
possessed of the fairest intentions in
the world for their children, had
become trapped in a godless community
before they were aware of it; all
because the seed-bed of human life had
not been plowed deep with social
religion at the very outset. Is this
community a fair example of bibleless
country groups? I believe it is. I
am sorry to admit it, but I believe it is
a fair type.</p>


<p><i>When the Bible Has No Interpreter</i></p>

<p>If a nation can not build civilization
securely without a knowledge of history,
neither can children build character
without a knowledge of those men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>and women of history who have essayed
to know God. The Bible is the
story of such persons. It is biography.
It is lives of those in whom the
soul of man in his search for God has
risen to its highest levels. There is no
substitute for this Bible biography,—except,
if you please, another Bible.</p>

<p>And perhaps, in point of Bible
illiteracy, next to the community which
has no Bible in it, lies the community
in which, though there is a Bible, the
leaders in teaching the Bible, or rather
in explaining the Bible to the children,
are themselves grossly ignorant, if not
demoralized. The Bible is a book of
many stories, of a host of incidents, of
innumerable ideas. Selection is vital.
To select from the Bible and hand on
its meaning in grave ignorance is to
run the risk that all ignorance runs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>Here is where many a rural community
suffers, when it is commonly thought
to be provided with a knowledge of
God.</p>

<p>It fell to my lot recently to visit a
small rural community of twenty-five
families of this type. Only three of
the families were totally without
church connections, or at least church
traditions. One church building has
fallen in. One lies torn down. The
third, still standing, is rotting. It is
supposed to be “haunted.” Splits disorganized
and discouraged the people.
A fourth rude church structure has
come, but splitting up from within has
begun. Ignorance of a crass sort
rules. The Bible has had no well-balanced
soul to interpret its wonderful
truths.</p>

<p>The family histories of this settlement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>run—to speak very grimly
indeed—like an anthology of despair
and depravity. Listen:</p>

<p>“She drowned her babies regularly
in the creek.”</p>

<p>“He was said to be the father of his
own daughter’s first child.”</p>

<p>“This woman was subnormal and
has three illegitimate children.”</p>

<p>“This other woman is a menace to
every man in the community.”</p>

<p>“He committed suicide.”</p>

<p>“She poured kerosene on the cat and
set fire to it.”</p>

<p>“Boil nails in water to find out if
person for which water is named committed
a crime. If nails crackle and
knock against the pan, then person
named is guilty.”</p>

<p>“A person dies hard on feathers.
We took mother’s bed out from under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>her three times when we thought she
was dying.”</p>

<p>“Our children don’t need to go to
school to learn to read. The Spirit
teaches them to read.”</p>

<p>The people of these families looked,
in the face, like people you meet in
any fair group of folks; but their
minds, their deeds, their hopes, their
fears! There’s the rub. Is this
group of twenty-five families typical
of country communities where the
Bible is fought over by blind leaders
of the blind? I am afraid it is. I
admit it with shame, but I admit it.
The Bible,—as if it were a plow found
by persons who knew not its use, but
who scrapped hard for its possession as
an ornament of their dooryards,—the
life-giving Bible in these hands is still
a closed book and a locked-up treasure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p><i>Pedigreed Austerity Better Than
Ignorance</i></p>

<p>Human life at its best is no mere accident
which may happen anywhere
under any conditions. The best has
its pedigree. It is the result of infinite
pains with children as with crops and
animals. Even the austere, narrow-gaged
leadership having a pedigree is
far better than this ignorant, illiterate
type.</p>

<p>I remember well as a lad how my
father, a country minister, collegebred
and trained in the theological school of
his particular denominational stripe,
stood rock-like in his parish for
temperance. It was a grape country,
with several wine distilleries. My
father taught abstention from wine-drinking
and preached against the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>distilleries. One church pillar was in
the wine business and furnished the
sacramental wine. My father finally
carried his logic to the point where he
made announcement:</p>

<p>“Next Sunday at the Communion
we shall not use fermented wine.”</p>

<p>Sunday came. A larger congregation
than usual assembled. There
was a tenseness of silent emotion in the
stiff Sunday-dressed village and
farmer folk, which I can feel yet, after
forty years.</p>

<p>The communion-table was set. I
see my father now, as he picked up the
flagon of wine and poured into the
chalice. He paused—on his face a
sudden look of bewilderment. Then
slowly he poured the chalice of wine
back into the flagon, strode to the door,
and emptied the contents on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>ground. Quietly resuming the ceremony
he said:</p>

<p>“We will commune without wine to-day.”</p>

<p>The distiller had done his dirty work
and put one over on the country
parson. But the parson, although he
caused a sense of consternation to
creep over the church folk,—akin to
the horror in the multitude when
<i>Count Antonio</i>, in Anthony Hope’s
tonic story, laid hands on the Sacred
Bones in midstream,—by this daring
act helped plug the bung-holes and
spike the spigots in the cellars of that
county. And the whole countryside,
be it said, responded to the resolute will
of my father to make God known to a
community steeped in wine.</p>

<p>My father probably shared the
narrow-mindedness of his particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>pedigree, but he certainly hewed to the
line like a prophet of old. His crop
of young converts came usually in
winter; but the snow and ice had no
deterring chill for him. He never
thought of postponing the baptismal
rite till summer. He had a large hole
cut through in the little river near by,
for water helped mightily in his system
of doctrine. He didn’t spare me
either. At eleven years of age, he led
me, as he did my country playmates,
out of the sleigh, down the snowbank,
into this ice-water. There was no
softening of the ideals of life in that
parish, I can tell you. And the God
of Daniel was known and acknowledged
there in fear and trembling.</p>

<p>When, in after years it fell to my
fortune to live on the Skims and to woo
sleep with logging, stumping, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>“scratching” the land, I saw what a
real Sunday-school would do even in
a submarginal community for the
children of the pine cut-over. There
was the farmer widow woman with the
man’s hands. What would have been
her chances of rearing her seven
children to usefulness and self-respect
without that weekly community-school
under good leadership?</p>

<p>I hear again her breezy, cheery call
to her brood as she drives up to the
little church.</p>

<p>“Pile out.”</p>

<p>“Pile in,” when Sunday-school is
over.</p>

<p>A slap of the lines, and a piece of
rural America goes back to its cabin,
minds sprayed with race lore. A
mighty wholesome sight in a community
of tools with broken handles, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>harnesses toggled with hay-wire, of
fortunes “busted”, of the blind, and of
those who could not sleep.</p>

<p>There was the old retired farmer,
Scotch McDugle, too, eighty years old.
He would come over from next door
of an evening and swap Skims stories
for a cheery welcome and a listening
ear. It would be midwinter. The
sheet-iron stove showed red.</p>

<p>“Come in, Mr. McDugle,” my wife
would say. “Take off your hat and
mittens.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” he would reply, “just
stepped in to say ‘howdy.’ Can’t stay
a minute.”</p>

<p>Then McDugle would settle down
for the evening close to the red-hot
stove, mittens drawn tight, Scotch cap
pulled close down over his ears. As
he got limbered in memory, he would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>go through a set of queer antics with
his lips and tongue—little dry, staccato
sputters. He reminded me in this of a
courtly neurasthene I once met who
said, as he went through similar tongue
motions, “I beg your pardon, but I
have a hair on the tip of my tongue
which I seem never able to get off.”</p>

<p>Farmer McDugle’s favorite theme
was the making of great American
men out of “hard knocks” and “a good
pinch of God.” He reveled in
Lincoln, whom he had known; and
he never got tired of weaving the people
he knew in with the race-heroes of
all time.</p>

<p>As I think of McDugle and his ilk
in these later days, I can not help
suspecting that bleak little Scotland
and God in the life, despite the stain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>of the “wee drap o’rye,” account for
many of America’s man-making rural
communities.</p>


<p><i>When Catholic and Protestant Agree</i></p>

<p>The chairman of the Board of
Directors of the National Catholic
Rural Life Conference, in a call
published (in the April 1924 number
of “St. Isadore’s Plow”) for the
second annual Catholic Rural Life
Conference, says:</p>

<p>“We have two distinct entities of
population, and, we might say, of
civilization in the United States—the
urban and the rural. The church is
decidedly urban. So far as the Church
is concerned, the country towns and
villages are still ‘pagani.’”</p>

<p>Thus you see Protestant and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>Catholic agree in seeing the menace of
rural paganism within the borders of
Christian America.</p>

<p>This is not the moment to settle the
blame for this condition on any persons
or sects. It is rather the time for
a statesmanlike move to meet the
menace. Bible instruction of worth,
dignity, intelligence, in every community,
made accessible to the last child,
is an aim which alone can meet the
case. But this is an herculean stunt,
and requires some of the same sweep
of coöperative, universal momentum
as drove out yellow fever, malaria, and
is fighting pellagra, hook-worm, and
tuberculosis. Bible illiteracy ranks as
a problem with book illiteracy; and as
great a unanimity is required to root it
out as to eradicate book illiteracy. A
hundred different religious bodies in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>the United States have striven more
or less fitfully in the past with this
problem. But far more is needed than
the hundred-headed effort. When, in
the late war, the Allies came to their
senses and found that their struggle
was not a rope-pull nor a barbecue,
but a life-or-death struggle, they
elected Foch to give universality of
will to the cause of defense.</p>

<p>The children of rural America
deserve by good rights a Foch to lead
the forces of Bible literacy against a
creeping, godless paganism. I have
refrained from presenting the religious
case for this crusade. The menace is
so great that the social appeal should
be sufficient—and should reach every
intelligent lover of America, be he
fundamentalist, modernist, ethicist, or
just plain man.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p>William James, the Harvard
psychologist, used to
say in his class-room: “I must
fight the devil and his wiles, for
God needs me. I may help save the
day.”</p>

<p>In the same room, the next hour,
Josiah Royce, the philosopher, would
say, “I must set my heel on Satan’s
neck, for God’s victorious spirit is in
me.”</p>

<p>Whichever of these two schools of
moral action one belongs to, one is
bound, you see, to fight the devil and
his guile; and in country life this is no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>joke, for as it turns out, the devil
waved a mighty wicked wand over the
American farm tenant when he jockeyed
him on to the land into the shoes
of the departing farm owner. It was
a devilish, cunning trick to decoy the
owner, body and soul, into town and
into the town church—away from the
little country church of his fathers. It
was, however, the meanest lick of
Satan against the peace of the tenant
to bewitch him into flitting from farm
to farm and from community to
community. And now the situation
has come to such a pass that, unless
the American church has the grace and
backbone and subtlety to outgeneral
the devil in his game, the devil wins;
for in matters of religion, the landless
man is between the devil and the deep
sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Churches Detour—Tenants Ahead</i>”</p>

<p>It is old stuff, in a way, this cheerless
story of farm tenants and religion.
Pick up, as I have done, either at
random or quite methodically, booklets,
chapters, articles, or pamphlets
dealing at first hand with the farm
tenant, and the tale of his religious
handicap runs drearily, hopelessly to
the same sad end. For example, take
this rather mild statement from a
member of Roosevelt’s Country Life
Commission:</p>

<p>“The farm owner who has moved to
town and is renting his land cannot be
expected to be a real, vital force in
the rural church. Nor can the tenant
who has a one-year lease, or whose
tenure is uncertain, be expected to
cultivate the Christian graces by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>intimate fellowship with his neighbors
and associates; in other words, to take
root in the community and become a
part of it.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” it will be asked, “try
to dress up the outworn subject
again?”</p>

<p>The plain answer, without any
apology, is simply this: The farm-tenant
case, as a phase of religion in
eclipse, has not yet cast an image on
the American mind. The American
church,—and I class together all the
Christian bodies in this sweeping term,—the
Christian conscience of the
American church has apparently reversed
itself and “passed by on the
other side” of this bedeviled situation.
Now such an attitude, such collective
behavior, is ruthless, well nigh unforgivable,
and in fact incomprehensible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>Words must continue to be spoken

around the tenant.</p>


<p><i>The Flood of Tenancy Unabated</i></p>

<p>And first of all, in order to see the
gravity of the case as it stands, one
must sense the resistless character of
the sweeping flow of tenancy itself.
Decade by decade the flood has risen.
In 1880, 25.6 per cent. of the farms in
the United States were tenant farms;
in 1890, 28.4 per cent.; in 1900, 35.3
per cent.; in 1910, 37.0 per cent.; in
1920, 38.1 per cent.</p>

<p>If one looks a little closer at the
regions where the flood is highest—almost
over the dikes, so to speak—the
truth strikes home a little stronger. In
the east South-central States, containing
Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>Mississippi, the percentage in 1880
was 35.2; in 1890, 38.6; in 1900, 49.1;
in 1910, 52.8; in 1920, 49.6. In the
west south-central area, containing Arkansas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas,
the percentage in 1880 was 35.2; in
1890, 38.6; in 1900, 49.1; in 1910, 52.8;
in 1920, 53.2. In the west north-central
area, containing, as a very vital
part of American agriculture, Minnesota,
Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, the
percentage in 1880 was 20.5; in 1890,
24.0; in 1900, 28.6; in 1910, 30.0; in
1920, 34.1.</p>

<p>When the United States Census
Report for 1920 came out and was
scanned, it was discovered by every one
that in the decade between 1910 and
1920 the flood of tenant farms had in
number gone down in some States a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>little, as in Alabama and Mississippi, a
fact which brought a decline in the east
south-central area from 52.8 per cent.
in 1910 to 49.6 per cent. in 1920. But
lest the friends of agriculture in
America should be put under ether by
this disclosure, Dr. C. L. Stewart, now
professor in the University of Illinois,
while a member of the United States
Department of Agriculture, in a statement
entitled, “The Persistent Increase
of Tenant Farming,” called
attention to the fact that the bare number
of tenant farms is a less accurate
index of the sweep and meaning of
tenancy than the acreage involved and
the value of that acreage:</p>

<p>“When measured on the basis of
acreage and value, the number of
rented acres per thousand and the number
of dollar’s worth of rented land per
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>thousand was not only higher (in 1910
and 1920) than that shown on the preceding
basis (number of rented farms),
but has been growing at much faster
rates during both of the decades since
1900, especially during the decade just
ended.... In the light of this analysis,
the tide of tenancy is shown by the
latest census to have continued with
little or no abatement.”</p>

<p>In sober truth, this flood-tide of tenancy
is no mere passing phenomenon
in the adolescent experience of America,
but is a settled characteristic now
being wrought into the texture of
American life. As a social and economic
force, tenancy is here to stay.
Statesmen may well build their dikes
higher against it; but American religious
leaders—the makers of ecclesiastical
policy—must from now on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>gravely take farm tenancy into their
reckoning, or assume spiritual responsibility
for its continued religionless
character.</p>


<p><i>Locating the Devil’s Quarry</i></p>

<p>Let us draw a bit closer to these tenant
folks and look them in the eyes. There
they are, in round numbers two and a
half millions of tenant operators; or,
perhaps, better reckoned for our purpose
as twelve millions of people,
counting all persons in the tenant families
both old and young. But, as almost
everybody knows, there are a few
vast differences among tenants, and we
must sift a little and sort out the group
that the devil is laying his finger on
and claiming as his own.</p>

<p>A tenant who is a son or daughter
of the landlord, or otherwise related to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>the landlord by blood or marriage, is
without question not only a privileged
person and his family a privileged
family among tenants, but, what is more
to the point, living on family lands as
he most generally does, the “related
tenant” is so often an owner in prospect
with a deed “in escrow” as the
law would put it, that while nominally
a tenant, he is an owner in thin
disguise, and virtually has in the community
the status of an owner. The
census does not declare what percentage
of the twelve millions of tenant
folk belongs to this favored class; but
whatever the percentage is, it is obviously
decreasing with the decreasing
percentage of owner-operating families.
Representative studies made by
the United States Department of Agriculture
indicate that 23 per cent. of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>the tenant population belongs at present
to this group. If we accept this
estimate, then, in 1920, there were
2,760,000 persons in the families of
“related tenants.”</p>

<p>To protect my story against the will
to exaggerate the landless element,
let us call the total number of “related
tenants” three millions; and then let
us deduct this whole group from the
twelve millions of tenant folks. This
leaves nine millions of tenants unprivileged
by birth or marriage in respect
to land.</p>

<p>Lest any one should feel, furthermore,
that I am trying to make, under
cover, a case of the colored tenant,—whose
situation is confessedly special
and should not, for obvious reasons, be
confused with that of white tenants,—let
us sift and sort again and take out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>three and a half millions of colored tenant
folk, old and young. The residuum
is five and a half millions of white
tenants. This is the group that has
swelled in numbers during the past
four decades. This is the group that is
all the time spreading over more and
more acres, all the time creeping on to
more and more valuable land. This
group of landless men, women, and
children (I do not mean to say that this
is the only landless group of white
farm people, for the agricultural-labor
class makes another story), occupying
more and more the strategic positions
in agriculture and country life, contains
the devil’s quarry.</p>


<p><i>Tenants On the Go</i></p>

<p>We must add one more particularly
distressing feature to our general picture.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>In December and January in
the South, or in March in the North,
there is a great stir among these tenants,
for moving-time has come. During
the year between December 1,
1921, and December 1, 1922, according
to a statement put out by the U. S.
Department of Agriculture, entitled,
“Farm Occupancy, Ownership, and
Tenancy, 1922,” “nearly 663,000 shifts
on farms exchanging tenants” occurred
of which “nearly 250,000 tenants
were indicated to have either discontinued
farming for some other
occupation or moved out of their communities.”</p>

<p>In this exodus, poverty tags along,
poverty carrying in her apron all the
witch’s ills—hard luck, dimmed lights
of the mind, illness, inferiority written
in behavior, stolid despair, indifference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>to improvement, insensibility to
refinements. In the South, poverty
hangs on to the coat-tails of the “Cropper”—him
of the lowest estate of the
tenant. In 1920, according to the
United States Census Report, there
were 227,378 white croppers, more than
one million white cropper folk.</p>

<p>Behold a host, comparable with the
host of Israel on the way to Canaan.
The roads are filled with teams, with
jags of household belongings, with led
or driven cattle, horses and mules, with
loads of women and children. A small
nation is folding its tents and moving
on ere its tents have fairly got pitched.
White tenants alone,—and mind you,
out of the group of five and a half millions
of landless people,—an army of
1,375,000 souls; and of these, more
than a half a million going across the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>border of the community into a strange
land for another short sojourn. This
is the picture you will see every year—over
a quarter of all tenants moving,
and ten per cent. of all tenants moving
into strange associations among
strange people.</p>


<p><i>Outcasts From the Church</i></p>

<p>In their recent study, “The Town and
Country Church,” Dr. H. N. Morse
and Dr. de S. Brunner, of the Institute
of Social and Religious Research, have
this convincing word to say about the
church and the farm tenant:</p>

<p>“The church in the country areas is
not, generally speaking, the church of
the landless man. In a study of all
the churches in 179 counties, located in
44 States, the situation, which we believe
is reliably representative of conditions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>in the United States as a whole,
is this: The percentage of farm owners
who are members of churches in the
South is 59.5, while of tenants who
are members the percentage is 33.5; in
the Southwest, of owners, 26.2, while
of tenants, 9.2; in the Northwest, of
owners, 16.4, while of tenants, 7.4; in
the Middle West, of owners, 47.9, while
of tenants, 20.3; in the Prairie, of owners,
55.6, while of tenants, 15.8.”</p>

<p>These two authorities on the farmer’s
church, draw from their study
of the high and low tenancy areas in
175 counties this further conclusion:
“The larger the proportion of farm
tenants in an area, the more conspicuously
unreached by the church is the
landless man.” Here are their figures,
see for yourself:</p>

<p>“In counties where tenancy runs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>from 0 to 10 per cent., the percentage
of farm owners who are church members
is 13.7, while the percentage of
tenants who are church members is
12.4; where tenancy runs from 11 to 25
per cent., the percentage of owners as
church members is 26.8, while of tenants,
19.8; where tenancy runs from 26
to 50 per cent., the percentage of
owners is 48.2, while of tenants, 23.6;
where tenancy runs over 50 per cent.,
the percentage of owners who are
church members is 63.6, while the percentage
of tenants who are church
members is 23.9.”</p>

<p>When we look into this statement,
it is plain that in the low tenancy areas
the “related tenants” on “family lands”
bulk large, and they rank, as we know,
with owners themselves; but when we
get into the high tenancy areas, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>strike the core of tenants unrelated to
the landlord. Here is the mass of
our 5,500,000 landless tenant folk, and
here is where the church has weakened
and fallen down. Five millions of
these white landless tenants are in the
high tenancy areas. And applying
this church study to our problem, while
the church reaches 55 per cent. of
the owners in these areas it reaches
only 24 per cent. of the tenants.
That is, 1,200,000 of these landless
tenants only are inside the circle of
direct religious influence, and 3,800,000
are outside. If these 5,000,000
persons had been owners of land, or inheritors
of land in waiting, the church
would have reached 2,750,000 of them
instead of 1,200,000; in other words
here are 1,550,000 tenant people who
are outcasts from the church simply because
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>they are landless folk. And
these outcasts—these religionless pariahs—are
on the increase from year to
year as tenancy increases its hold upon
the nation.</p>

<p><i>One Hundred Per Cent. Material
for Religion</i></p>

<p>It surely will not be misunderstood
if a layman should call to mind that the
genius of Christianity is its perennial
Gospel—just good news—to the poor,
the broken in life’s struggle. If a fitter
multitude than these tenants for
the good tidings of the Christ can be
found on the face of the earth, I would
like to learn of them. The ordinary
life of these outcasts, these wanderers
from spot to spot seeking the sun that
refuses to shine, has precisely all of
those breakdowns which the Christian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>religion promises to repair—poverty,
invalidism, death, sin. It seems to me
that these pariahs are just naturally
made to order for the kind of religion
that the American church has to offer;
but as I see it, and I have looked this
thing in the face from angle after
angle, they haven’t got a ghost of a
show at it the way the church system
of the country at present works out.
Speaking straight from the shoulder,
the devil wins, unless—And where is
the person who will rise and name the
great “unless” that can fix this church
system up and set the heel of the
church on Satan’s neck?</p>

<p>The history of the church, running
back through the centuries, is, as I read
it, dotted with awakenings, with the
rise of a thought, of a hope-dream,
with the rise of a man who out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>very fog and blackness of popular
waywardness, wantonness, unbelief,
depravity, has stood up and successfully
denied that human life must be
all to the strong and that the poor must
live unillumined. This has been the
type of man who has lit the torch of
love and solicitude and faith in the
world that has lighted the race generation
after generation. Is this not the
time in the life of the American church
and this the occasion in America for
such a man to arise and call a halt upon
the detour of the church around the
farm tenant?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p>“Hireling!” A sour epithet to
hand a preacher; but the word is
not mine. Look at it, if you will, in its
original setting and judge for yourself:</p>

<p>“I am the good shepherd; the good
shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
But he that is an hireling, and not the
shepherd, whose own the sheep are not,
seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the
sheep, and fleeth.... The hireling
fleeth, because he is an hireling, and
careth not for the sheep.”</p>

<p>So spake the Man of Sorrows, who,
as he went about preaching the Gospel
of the Kingdom, spake as never man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>spake. And nineteen centuries of unbroken
Christian usage look down upon
“pastor and flock” as an almost perfect
characterization of preacher and parish.
Passing quickly through the
gateway leading up to the porch of my
tale, let me in a few words taken from
“Town and Country Church in the
United States,” set before you the
pastor-and-flock-hard-luck story in rural
America:</p>

<p>“The total number of communities
within the town (town refers to places
of 5,000 people or less) and country
area is 73,230.”</p>

<p>“There are 33,808 communities, or
42 per cent. of the total number, that
have churches, but do not have within
them any resident pastors.”</p>

<p>“It would require 34,181 more ministers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>giving their full time to the work
of the ministry to provide one for each
community, if they were evenly distributed.”</p>

<p>“The great advantage of the town
over the village, and of both town and
village over the country, in the matter
of resident pastors, is a characteristic
of all regions and of virtually all counties.
Thus, while 78 out of every 100
town churches have resident pastors,
and 60 out of every 100 village
churches, only 17 out of every 100
country churches have them, and less
than 5 out of every 100 country
churches have full-time resident pastors.”</p>

<p>In a nutshell, this is the inglorious
fact: 30,000 flocks in rural America
have no shepherds. Thirty thousand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>rural flocks are open to the wolf—because
(for it so appears) American
preachers care not for country sheep.</p>


<p><i>Sentenced to Purgatory</i></p>

<p>An eminent rural-life leader a few
weeks ago came back from a country-life
conference of rural ministers, reporting
that these ministers had a saying
among them, “A country charge
(pastorate) is a sentence to purgatory.”</p>

<p>This report sounds like a piece of
clerical humor; grim, maybe, but harmless
and meaning nothing. Would
to God this were true! Then perhaps
the picture of these 30,000 shepherdless
flocks might turn out to be only a
nightmare. I tried to shake the thing
out of my mind; but immediately the
long line of my ministerial acquaintances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>passed unwillingly before me;
and I solemnly affirm that, with a few
princely exceptions, these men after
being plunged into their ministry,
coming up for air, as it were, faced toward
the city parish as flowers turn
toward the light; from the country,
they struck out for the village; from
the village, they struck out for the
town; from the town, they struck out
for the city; from the city, they struck
out for the metropolis.</p>


<p><i>The Preacher’s Flight</i></p>

<p>The more I struggled to free myself
from a conclusion on this matter,
the deeper into conviction I sank. I
recalled, much against my inclination,
a bad half-hour several years ago at
the headquarters of one of the great
religious bodies of America. The occasion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>was the meeting of the National
Social Service Commission of that denomination.
I had just finished reading
a report, which expressed the idea
that we might look forward to the day
when country parishes would be put
up in packages containing people
enough supporting one church, so that
churches in the country would be as
powerful, ministers in the country
would be as influential, as city churches,
on the one hand, and city ministers
on the other. A captain of city industry
was a member of the commission.
During my paper, hands in pockets,
he paced the floor up and down—somewhat
to my discomfiture as I recall.
When I concluded reading, he broke
out with:</p>

<p>“Bosh! All bosh! The country
church will always be of little account.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>It gets culls for ministers—it always
has; it always will. Just as I left the
farm for the city to improve my lot,
so every country minister who can will
leave the country parish for the city
parish to improve his lot.”</p>

<p>That I suffered a shock as if by
lightning may easily be imagined.
The steel-blue tone of this man did
something to my heart; did something
to my faith in human nature hard to define.
This captain of industry—and
I suspect that this is what did the damage—never
seemed to question the
legitimacy of the preacher’s flight.
Representing, as he did, the leading
laymen of his denomination, quietly
accepting the exodus of country
preachers as perfectly normal—because
running true to the economics
of good business instinct—he appalled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>me with his cynicism. And it took me
many a month, I confess, to get back
my belief in humankind. But it came
back, and came back strong in the following
manner:</p>


<p><i>Around the Glover’s Cot</i></p>

<p>By accident, one summer, I made a
find; in one of the 30,000 pastorless
parishes, a man lying prone on a cot;
the cot standing on a stone-boat; the
stone-boat lying close to a deep pool
in the bend of a little river, in the shade
of a great elm-tree; the man all alone,
flat on his back, silently whipping the
trout-pool with his fly. I came to believe
in this helpless fisherman, and
again all things good and beautiful
seemed possible. I got the story from
his sister, but can give only hints of
it here.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>
<p>As a boy on the farm he had made
up his mind to get an education. At
sixteen he was looking forward impatiently
to beginning his courses of
study, when one day in the woods a
tree which the men folks were cutting
down fell on him and broke his back.
He never walked again, nor, in fact,
ever again sat up. Doomed to lie on
his back, all his hopes blighted, he
asked for something to do with his
hands. They gave him needle and
thread, shears and a piece of buckskin.
He made a pair of clumsy buckskin
gloves. He made a less clumsy pair.
He made pair after pair, better and
still better. Then dozens of pairs, until
his skill built up a small business.
But his ambition mounted with success,
and he asked whether he couldn’t
study something.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<p>“Can’t I study law?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>They got him law-books. He read
law, he made buckskin gloves; he made
gloves, he read law. He was admitted
to the bar. He became justice-of-the-peace
in his backwoods settlement.
Men got to coming for miles to the
glover’s cot to tell their troubles and
look into his deep eyes, hear his counsel,
and feel his glad hand. He was a real
peacemaker under the guise of a lawyer.
His ethics backed up to and
rested upon the Sermon on the Mount.
He bought land, hired it tilled, built
himself a better house, and settled into
the character of a country squire. He
was of the little church flock, and the
rest of the flock came to set great store
by his good sense, his wholesome cheer,
indomitable activity, and, withal, his
straight reliance on God. In fact, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>helpless glover’s dwelling was the
meeting-place for the flock about as
often as the church building; for everybody
said, “We get new strength to
keep a-going when we meet around
the cot.”</p>


<p><i>The Modern Wolf a Playful Cub?</i></p>

<p>See how I got back my faith? The
prone fisherman on his stone-boat was
a godsend to me. I saw that personal
life is so rich that no one can be broken
in body to the point where, in case he
“layeth down his life for the sheep,” he
will be making a mean gift. I half suspect
that God raises up out of the
ground, as it were, in many of these
pastorless communities a proxy for the
parson that, beholding the wolf, leaveth
the sheep and fleeth to the city—a
proxy, like the glover-lawyer, who is no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>quitter. And in some parishes where
the preacher still sticks (his face set,
however, toward the city) I fancy a
man or a woman or a child can be found
who is naïvely scaring off the wolf.</p>

<p>Norris Shepardson was such a man.
Farmer, poet, refined spirit, he went
about his work making everybody
believe that a new day is fresh from
God. Ambrose Brimmer, a member of
the community, didn’t happen to be
much of a churchman, and his Sunday
haymaking teased the parson mightily.
I remember well one perfect trout
day, when Ambrose was showing me the
holes in a stream strange to my
rod, that we got to talking about
preachers.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a damn if the parson
does see me haying on Sunday,” said
Ambrose; “but if I get a sight of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>Norris Shepardson driving up the
road, I skedaddle and hide, you bet!
You know Norris Shepardson. Well,
Norris Shepardson is a Christian and
no quack.”</p>

<p>And Ambrose was right. Norris
Shepardson was a Christian from his
eyelashes to his finger-tips; and his
sweet belief in you put you straightway
under obligation to goodness when he
cast a glance your way.</p>

<p>It is probably true that I have been
something of a modern-life fan. But
when I try to think of the Master’s
parables of the shepherd, the sheep, and
the wolf, and of the one sheep that was
lost while the ninety and nine were
safe in the fold, I confess that I am
troubled about my modern-life philosophy.</p>

<p>Are modern sheep any the less in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>need of a downright shepherd because
they are modern?</p>

<p>Isn’t there a wolf any longer in times
that are modern? Or may he perhaps
be just a playful cub? Or possibly,
by this time, a toothless, plain, doddering
beastling?</p>

<p>Has the age of lofty heroism in religion—the
age of sheer contempt of
some of the traditional goods of life—clean
passed away? And does economics
furnish the better clue in
modern days to those who are called of
God to preach?</p>

<p>Do we need any 30,000 more
preachers in the country trenches?
Do we need any shock troops at all?
Isn’t it perfectly orthodox pacifism in
these days for all the picked soldiers
in the war on the devil to fall back into
comfortable winter quarters?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p><i>Side-stepping the Law of Hire</i></p>

<p>I try to find my answer to these
troubling queries in a glance down the
centuries. There are the barefoot
Black Friars of Dominic and the Gray
Friars of Francis of Assisi (him who
took poverty for his bride) in the
thirteenth century. They gloried in
mean clothes, mean shelter, mean food,
as they ministered out of their own
poverty to the poor, the overlooked,
the no-accounts (in cities, then,
because the troop of comfortable
parsons were fattening in the popular
country districts).</p>

<p>There are the visionaries and enthusiasts:
John Bunyan in the seventeenth
century; John and Charles
Wesley in the eighteenth. In the very
face of the plentiful, complacent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>clergy, they fought the wolf as if they
had been apostles living in the first
century.</p>

<p>There is Jean Frederick Oberlin, in
the early part of the nineteenth
century, who protested, “I do not wish
to labor in some comfortable pastoral
charge where I can be at ease. I want
a work to do which no one else wishes
to do, and which will not be done unless
I do it.”</p>

<p>Oberlin had just won his degree of
Doctor of Philosophy at the University
of Strasburg, at a time when
Strasburg was a city of France. His
“call” to pastoral duty came all of a
sudden with the wind of a February
evening rushing in at the door as a
stranger stepped into the bare room.
Struck with the poverty of the place,
Pastor Stuber introduced himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>Beard’s translation from the French
presents us with the picture:</p>

<p>“I have learned about you, Herr
Oberlin. Your name has been mentioned
to me as one who does not follow
the beaten paths of ministerial
candidates. You have studied surgery
and medicine. You have a knowledge
of botany and herbs. Is this not
so?”</p>

<p>“In my leisure hours I have paid
some attention to botany, to blood-letting,
and the experiences of the
anatomical room,” replied Oberlin.</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough to explain
to me what this little pan means that
I see here by your lamp?” asked
Stuber.</p>

<p>A deep blush ran over Oberlin’s
face. “Pardon the cooking, Herr
Pastor. I take my dinner with my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>parents, and I bring away some bread
which my mother gives me. At eight
o’clock I put this little pan over my
lamp, place my bread in it, with a
little water and salt. Then I go on
with my studies.”</p>

<p>“You are my man!” exclaimed
Stuber, rising from his chair. “You
live on the diet of Lacedæmon. Yes,
you are my man. I see you do not
understand me; but I have got my
man, and I shall not let you go. I
want you for the pastorship of
Waldbach in the Ban-de-la-Roche.
There a hundred poor and wretched
families in want of the bread of life;
four or five hundred to shepherd and to
save, poor, wretched, friendless.”</p>

<p>Oberlin’s heart was in a tumult.
This was just the field of labor he had
wished. But what of the difficulties?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>
<p>“The parish must be in a very cold
region,” suggested Oberlin.</p>

<p>“My dear Oberlin, I do not wish to
exaggerate anything. Six months of
winter; at times the cold of the Baltic;
sometimes a wind like ice comes down
from the mountain-tops above; the sick
and dying are to be visited in remote,
wild, solitary places in the forests.”</p>

<p>“And the parishioners, are they well
disposed?” inquired Oberlin.</p>

<p>“Not too much so, not too much.
They are frightfully ignorant and untractable,
and proud of their ignorance.
It is an iron-headed people, a
population of Cyclops.”</p>

<p>Oberlin was taking in the situation.
He slowly lifted his large blue eyes
and asked: “You say most of the
parishioners are extremely poor? Are
there resources to aid the poor?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>
<p>“The parishioners have nothing.
Four districts even poorer than the
mother parish are to be served. Not
a single practicable road. Deep mud-holes
among the cabins. The people,
abandoned to indifference, have not the
least concern to meliorate their condition.”</p>

<p>“Every one of your words has
knocked at the door of my heart like
the blows of a hammer,” said Oberlin.
And it was settled that Oberlin
would go to the mountains; and on
March 30, 1767, in his twenty-seventh
year, Oberlin arrived at
Waldbach.</p>

<p>No single piece of literature equals
the story of Jean Frederick Oberlin’s
pastorate in the Ban-de-la-Roche as an
interpretation of a country minister’s
social, economic, and religious relation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>to his parish. Overture after overture
came to him during the years to give
up his laborious cares in the hills and
take charge of a church where cultured
life would bring with it superior advantages,
greater recognized honor,
and a satisfactory salary. His answer
was the same to all:</p>

<p>“No, I will never leave this flock.
God has confided this flock to me.
Why should I abandon it?”</p>

<p>And in that out-of-the-way parish
he played the shepherd and the man for
nigh on to sixty years. Like the
Venerable Bede in the eighth century,
he died with the shepherd’s crook in his
hand.</p>


<p><i>Preachers’ Alibis Pass Inspection</i></p>

<p>Now tell me, was Oberlin—remember
he is only a hundred years away from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>our time—temperamental and absurdly
heroic? Was the nineteenth-century
wolf any less tender with the
nineteenth-century flock than the first-century
wolf with the first-century
flock? Is the modern “world-the-flesh-and-the-devil”
just a bugaboo to
frighten children? Is modern sin a
whiter stain on the soul and more easily
washed out than in any previous century?
It would take a braver man
than I am to champion modern life to
such lengths.</p>

<p>These 30,000 runaway American
preachers,—they all have good reasons
for running. As alibis go, they are
perfect—humanly speaking. I have
often heard the recital: “Easier life
for the wife,” “education for the children,”
“an American standard of living,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>“congenial parish,” “books,”
“travel,” “art,” “greater opportunity
for service.”</p>

<p>Just such reasons as bankers, clerks,
teachers, merchants give for their
economic movements—to better themselves,
following the law of hire. And
nobody protests; for nobody is in a
position to protest, as the law of hire
seems to regulate the life of all. The
protest—the only great protest—comes
everlastingly up from the first
century:</p>

<p>“A certain scribe came, and said unto
Him, Master, I will follow Thee
whithersoever Thou goest. And Jesus
saith unto him, The foxes have
holes, and the birds of the air have
nests; but the Son of man hath not
where to lay his head.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p><i>The Plight of Him Who Stays</i></p>

<p>The preacher that sticks by the
farm community takes pot-luck with
the farmer himself; and the socio-economic
plight of the farmer has had
front-page head-lines since the time of
President Theodore Roosevelt. To-day,
in the time of President Calvin
Coolidge, those head-lines have become
bigger and blacker. The farmer’s dollar,
meanwhile, has become small and
weak. His taxes have risen overnight
like a spring freshet. His debts stare
him in the face. His children are forsaking
him for the high wages and high
life of the city. He cannot pay the
wages of labor in competition with
automobile factories.</p>

<p>The farmer’s social system in America
has broken down under the strain of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>new forces. He needs the social help
of men and women who will share his
life, his privations, his hopes and fears.
But they are to be men and women
who see the farmer’s plight and, giving
themselves to the task, struggle to organize
a modern rural social system.
It is fruitless here to recite the tale
of an underpaid country clergy, with
its sequel of a socially visionless, untrained
set of honest parsons; fruitless
to point out how denominational
strife has cut down the preacher’s salary
to less than a living wage. True,
the country parson has his poverty,
and needs not to take any extra “vow of
poverty.” This sort of thing will go
on and on until there is a right-about
on the part of those preachers who flee
the country as if it were the plague.
Strong men of social vision, men who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>have come to understand the farmer’s
social and economic plight, must turn
their back on the city, and take up labors
for the country flock.</p>


<p><i>A New Type of Training School</i></p>

<p>But will there ever be such a right-about-face
of virile, holy men until we
have in America a new type of theological
seminary for the training of
country-bound ministers of Christ?
I doubt it. The present schools of
training are city-set, city-wise, city-satisfied;
not but that a score or more of
them give some “rural courses”; not but
that a trickle of men has started already
from them toward the country. You
can better understand the case if I
were to ask what hope there would
have been for agricultural science, if
total reliance had been placed upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>great city universities, Harvard, Yale,
Columbia, Chicago, Pennsylvania, to
develop the practice of farming. Each
of these universities has already made
some notable contribution to agriculture
in one form or another; but the
great hope of agriculture lay in a farming
college, and fortunately, the common
sense of this country perceived
this truth.</p>

<p>In like manner, the hope of the rural
ministry, in my estimation, lies in a
rural theological seminary under the
eaves of one of our great colleges of
agriculture—preferably a college of
agriculture in close proximity to a
great state university. Here is the
farmer’s intellectual center. Here are
gathered men and women of hope for
farm life. Here are the men and
women who have social vision for rural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>society. In touch with these men and
women, under the spell of the intelligent
hope for the American farm
and farmer, a school of religion can
grow up which will train men to go into
the country and help redeem it from
its present social chaos. They can
carve out community churches of distinction.
They can create a line of
such churches, wholly in rural territory,
which will furnish steps of promotion
for the most strenuous and ambitious
pastors. Flight is not the cure of the
plight of country parsons. The cure
is rather intelligent consecration to the
country flocks.</p>

<p>“But,” went on the author of
Christian idealism,—mind you, in
the same breath in which He had paid to
His followers the superb compliment,
“Ye are the salt of the earth,”—“if the
salt have lost its savor—”</p>

<p>And the story of Protestant home
missions in rural America during the
last two or three decades has in it the
taste of this “lost savor.”</p>

<p>Let me lay bare before you,—with
the shame of a churchman very much
embarrassed, it must be confessed,—not
so much the facts of this unsavory
home-mission story, for the facts have
been public property for some years, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>an interpretation of the facts and an
appraisal of the damage done to
American churchdom.</p>

<p>For the benefit of him who does not
understand the situation at all, a word
is necessary. Here is the picture, and
here are the essential features in the
picture, whatever variations there may
be in minor details.</p>


<p><i>Twice Too Many Churches</i></p>

<p>A community of rural folk of a definite
population is spread out before you.
Christian churches, usually from two to
ten in number, are alive, if not all going
concerns in the community. Whatever
differences there may be in the
membership rolls—and of course we
shall expect many points of difference
here—or in the number of services per
week or per month, or in the presence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>or absence of resident pastors, or in
the organization of the churches into
Sunday-schools, mission societies, clubs,
social committees and the like—whatever
the variations may be, I say, the
number of persons in the community,
counting every single soul, is far short
of enough to man all of the churches,
use any reputable standard of church
organization you please to measure by.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the type community
in question, some or all of the churches
are weak and ineffective, if not virtually
down and out. Moreover,—and
this is the central feature of the picture,—one
church is, or several or all of
these churches are, receiving subsidies
in the form of money from the home-mission
funds of the respective denominational
state body or national body
or both, the sum of money being just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>enough to keep the particular church
competitively in the running in that
community.</p>

<p>The essential fact in this situation
may be stated thus: In a community
where there is known to be a mass
of persons (in commercial parlance,
“volume of business”) sufficient to build
and maintain only from one to five
churches, there are actually found to
be from two to ten; and the excess of
churches over and above the number
which the volume of business justifies
is the direct result of the injection of
home-mission money into the community.</p>


<p><i>Veiled Hate</i></p>

<p>It does not require a clever mind to
know what will happen. When from
two to ten kernels of corn are planted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>in a piece of soil which has nutritive
elements sufficient to bring only from
one to five stalks to maturity, we know
that a struggle for life is on which may
doom one stalk, several stalks, or even
all stalks. It is so with the competitive
churches; but the corn simile fails
to illustrate the case at the really tragic
point. The subsidized churches, which
make up the redundance, create in the
community what is known by everybody
there to be a case of veiled malignancy.
Self-respecting persons either
hold themselves aloof from formal religion
there, or, conscience-stricken,
stand helplessly bewildered, or in plain
disgust they pick up and leave. And
the community turns sour. The salt
has lost its savor.</p>

<p>If you would sense the disaster of
this competition, please read between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>the lines of the following resolution,
passed within the last year, by a minister’s
association in a small rural community
where six Protestant churches
are breathing the air that is hardly
enough for three!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whereas we are joined together as
Christian ministers in the association
of brotherly fellowship and helpful co-working,
we hereby agree that the
following principles shall guide and
control us individually, and, so far as
our proper influence can go, our several
congregations in our mutual relationships....</p>

<p>I. That we decline and discourage
proselytizing in any form.</p>

<p>II. While we recognize that every
man is free to worship where and as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>wills, yet we realize that shifting from
one denomination to another save from
absolute religious conviction is not
edifying, but harmful. Wherefore,
we will not encourage those who from
pique or temporary dissatisfaction with
ministers or people of their own local
congregations wish to unite with ours.</p>

<p>III. That we will not, save in exceptional
cases, receive into our Sunday-schools
as regular members thereof,
children of families who are affiliated
with other congregations of the town.</p>

<p>IV. That whenever we come across
new-comers to the town who are
affiliated with, or declare preference
for, some Christian body other than our
own we will not (if the church of their
choice be represented by a congregation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>here) ask them to unite with our
congregation or send their children to
our Sunday-school until we have given
to the minister or church officials of the
church of their preference the name
and address of such persons, and
allowed reasonable opportunity for
them to claim their own.”</p>
</div>

<p>It is clear on the face of it that the
recognized principles of Christianity
have failed to keep these churches
sweet to one another; and resort is,
therefore, had to a contract—a perfectly
human document of agreement, such as
governs sinners in mundane business—in
hope that an-out-and-out bargain
may accomplish what Christian love
can not.</p>

<p>These ministers agree <i>not</i> to proselytize,
<i>not</i> to encourage lifting members
from another church, <i>not</i> to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>receive children into the Sunday-school
from families of another flock, <i>not</i> to
pick up new-comers without advertising
them and waiting a reasonable
length of time for a claimant. This
document of “nots”—of things not to
be done—naïvely uncovers the teasing
things that were done behind curtains.</p>


<p><i>Dispensing With Mission Aid</i></p>

<p>Before reading further, you will wish
to know whether there is much of this
sort of thing going on in rural America;
whether, in fact, it is not fussing
over trifles to beckon anybody to look
at this thing.</p>

<p>The best authorities, after a long
study on this subject, are quoted as
estimating that the amount of Protestant
home-mission money annually
wasted in competitive religion in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>rural communities is at present $3,000,000;
and if we may generalize from
twenty-five thoroughly studied counties,
widely separated, where there are
211 churches aided by home-mission
money, of which 149 are disastrously
competitive, “most of the home-mission
aid which is now granted could be withdrawn
without any danger whatsoever
of leaving communities (rural) with inadequate
facilities.”</p>

<p>The official report goes on to say,
“Aside from any possible loss in denominational
prestige, which a purely
objective study such as this can not
undertake to measure, on a careful examination
of all the data at hand, it
seems that 149 of the 211 aided
churches in these counties might be dispensed
with, to the general advantage
of the religious life in their communities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>and to the greater glory of the
Kingdom of God.”</p>

<p>This thing, look at it from any angle
you please, is as rust on the wheat, a
rot in the potato, a blight on the peach-tree,
a boll-weevil in the cotton. God
knows that the farmer already carries
along enough of a handicap in community
matters without being afflicted
with this canker on his religion, as a
discipline. It certainly looks like
jumping on the man that’s down. But
this sin against the farmer is not the
worst of the wicked business.</p>


<p><i>Worse Than Wasted</i></p>

<p>What hurts most in this paradoxical
practice is the prostitution of the most
beautiful gift in all religion.</p>

<p>“Missions!”</p>

<p>The very word conjures up angels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>of mercy. It brings to mind the last
words of Christ to his disciples and to
his followers of all time. And this
mission money (it is not so pathetic
that it sometimes is the widow’s mite or
that it is sometimes earned in feebleness
with many a pain) is the purest
money handled by men. It is the visible
sign of tears of longing for love to
govern men. Missions are the church’s
great romance. When out of the barrenness
and weakness of my little life,
I put into the hands of the church a gift
for the whomsoever, in faith, I do it
with a prayer that it will help bring
peace to some soul, harmony to some
family, blessing to some community
which is beyond my power otherwise
to help.</p>

<p>To think, then, that the tip of your
prayer and mine, the sweetest thing we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>can give, is poisoned, and shot into a
rural community, there to hurt—Well
the words are not so much wanting
to express my indignation and
yours, as the mind fails to comprehend
how such tactless blunders can happen.</p>

<p>“Why do these church bodies do this
wicked thing?” you enquire.</p>

<p>Let the words of a high church official
I once knew convey to you not so
much the real reason, as the state of
mind out of which the thing grows!</p>

<p>“So long as there is a family of our
faith in that village, that family shall
have the sacraments of our faith ministered
to it.”</p>

<p>He might just as well have added,
“even though the heavens fall”; for
what he did was to force a subsidy into
a community to help a small faction
of his particular church to survive when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>the majority of the people, even the
majority of his own little church organization,
had voted voluntarily to cut
down the number of churches and eliminate
the unnecessary one. The high
church official just ripped open a
community sore, when it had begun to
heal. He poured gall in again after
somebody had sweetened community
life for a moment.</p>


<p><i>A New Religious Ethics Between
Churches</i></p>


<p>The egotism of a particular church
group; the flaunting individualism of
a particular denominational combination
of persons, whose personal egos
are, religiously, to be subjected, but
whose combined ego is to be exalted!
Here is an uncharted sea of ethics and
religion between church groups. Shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>it not be discussed? Especially when
it grinds the rural community to powder?
Shall it be good Christianity for
one Christian sect to crowd and shove
just like a bully in a mob?</p>

<p>The day and generation is getting
suspicious of pietists of all sorts who
can tell sinners how to behave individually
to one another; yes, who can even
tell the labor group how to behave to
the employer group and the employer
group to the labor group, but who have
no conception of what Christian principles
apply as between one church
group and another church group in the
realm of religion, except to beat the
other church group at all costs. If I
were not heart and soul captured by the
character, life, philosophy, and guidance
of Jesus himself, if I were not
thrilled by his words, and electrified by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>his life and death, more and more the
older I grow, I should be tempted to
see in this cutthroat group egotism of
competitive Christian church groups
a decline of Christianity itself.</p>

<p>“They all do it” is a lame excuse for
sinners; but for a church body, it is
tragic. Think of a million people,
more or less, possessing one shibboleth,
trying to embody earnestly the
Christ, while deliberately hamstringing
another Christian church body which is
doing the same thing!</p>

<p>But who is to blame? Whose sin is
this prostitution of a holy thing?</p>

<p>Did you ever happen to know the officials
at the head of a Protestant
church body, either national or state?
Did you ever know the persons who
distribute home-mission money after
it is once collected? Did you ever get
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>a glimpse of the inside? Well, if so,
then you know how intensely human
this situation is. You know how complex
are the forces that operate, how
like politics are the powers behind the
locked doors. You know then that
when you try to track this sinner, you
can’t find him. Nobody does the thing.
Nobody does anything. Nobody is to
blame. The Christian leaders are not
leading on such matters. They are
fighting the individual sins of the
people.</p>

<p>What would America think of a
great Christian leader who should come
out and insist that Christian churches
ought to love, respect, defer to other
Christian churches? What a stir in
Christendom it would make for a great
man carrying his own church with him,
let us say, to go up and down the land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>preaching that membership in one
Christian church should thereby make
us members in all Christian churches;
preaching that we should discount
all the differences among Christian
churches and love all Christian churches
for their likenesses?</p>

<p>Look at this straw:</p>

<p>In Canada an outstanding movement
is nearing completion to unite
organically three great Protestant
bodies, affecting more than three
quarters of a million of church members.
The daily press recently in
explanation of the union, carried this
item:</p>

<p>“The Union had its origin in the
conviction that many separate
churches of each denomination, especially
in the rural districts, were
handicapped in limited membership and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>were unable to maintain properly
separate buildings and ministers. It is
therefore a part of a tendency in many
other countries to submerge religious
differences in an effort at wider and
more effective service.”</p>

<p>This looks on the horizon like the
peep of dawn of a new Christian day—and
what a dawn for the rural community
that would be!</p>

<p>But—lest we be too sanguine—that
dawn has some climb to make yet.
Has not the Home Mission Council of
the Federal Council of Churches in
America put into practice on the
Western frontier for several years
principles of denominational courtesy?
Have not the phrases of their documents
on “Overchurching,” “Underchurching,”
and “Wasteful Competition”
seeped very generally throughout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>the settled portions of the United
States, as well as into the frontier?
Have not the Foreign Mission Boards
of the various denominations for years
gained conspicuously the confidence of
their laymen by the intelligent distribution
of territory among the missions of
different church bodies abroad? The
fact is and must be reckoned with that
all the words and phrases and ideas and
logic on this subject, pro and con,
have been bandied about until they are
almost threadbare. The will to do,
however, is still very stubborn in old,
established communities.</p>

<p>“What is the difference between
a state university and an ordinary
university?”</p>

<p>A rather silly question, perhaps; but
the answer that came back, lightning-like,
gave me the jolt of my life, and incidentally
picked out in my mind the
pattern for the community church. Here
is the occasion and what took place:</p>

<p>A reception for the distinguished
regents of the University of Wisconsin
at the home of the president. In due
time I found myself approaching that
awful reception line, terrifying, indeed,
to me, a new-comer. Suddenly I became
aware that I was shaking hands
with the president, whose newness to the
job of presiding over a university had
not entirely worn off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>
<p>It was up to me to say something,
and so, after the manner of a pedagogue,
I blurted out a question:</p>

<p>“Mr. President, will you tell me the
difference between a state university
and an ordinary university?”</p>

<p>President Van Hise didn’t hesitate
an instant with his answer.</p>

<p>“I cannot speak for all state universities,”
said he, “but this university is
run not for the students who happen to
be here, but for the persons who may
never see the university—even to the
last man, woman, and child in the last
community of the State.”</p>

<p>I had become unconscious of the reception
line, for I was startled with an
idea foreign to my bringing up, and I
must make sure that I perfectly understood.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” I interrupted, “do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>you mean to say that the University
of Wisconsin is not proud of turning
out highly developed personalities?”</p>

<p>“Only as carriers,” President Van
Hise quickly replied, in his characteristic
jerky manner; “carriers of ideas
and attitudes even to the isolated community
and to the unpromising man.
The students who are here are here, as it
were, by accident. But the university
is run for Wisconsin’s people at work.”</p>

<p>I passed on down the line, and eventually
out into a world strange to me,
where being a “carrier” of intellectual
goods to the “isolated community” and
to the “last man” was an academic
commonplace.</p>

<p>Fourteen years of that day-by-day
commonplace, however, never rubbed
off the beauty of its bloom for me; for
here was a university running at least
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>neck and neck with church Christians
in love for,—or duty to, if you prefer
it so,—the Gospel’s whomsoever.</p>

<p>Having seen with my own eyes
these last communities of a State
quickened into intellectual fervor
through the devotion of university men
and women, do you think I do not know
what would happen to the spiritual life
of these out-of-the-way communities if
the supreme love of devoted church
men and women were brought to bear
upon them?</p>


<p><i>A Forecast Founded on Fact</i></p>

<p>I will venture to forecast some of the
things that would happen. Every
rural community would have a community
church—a church for the whomsoever,
even to the last man, woman,
and child in that community. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>topographically possible, every such
church community would stretch the
bounds of its parish to include a
thousand souls all told. In communities
of two thousand souls, there
would be two churches—two only, and
both community churches. In communities
of three thousand souls, there
would be three community churches,
and three churches only, every church,
a community church; and no more
churches than one to one thousand of
the community population; for it takes
one thousand of the population to maintain
an effectual modern church; and
every church is to be a Christian community
church as a safeguard against
paganism. But why am I so foolish
as to foretell what would happen when
I can tell what is happening?</p>

<p>There are to-day, we are told by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>those who keep informed on the matter,
a thousand community churches
in the United States, of which the
greater part are in rural territory. In
fact, it is reported that new community
churches are being organized at the rate,
at present, of six a month. To say
that there is a community church movement
well-started is no exaggeration.
Some States such as Massachusetts,
Vermont, Connecticut, Ohio, California,
Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, are
outstanding in the movement.</p>

<p>Of course, the community church is
not yet standardized, but it is shaping
up. To affirm that there are three
types, as some say, or five, as others
put it, is more or less arbitrary. Still,
for the sake of the man who understands
better by types, I may say that
some community churches like to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>known as having arrived at the community
ideal by “federation” of two or
more denominational churches, the new
church preserving connection with a
national church body.</p>

<p>Other community churches pride
themselves on being “union” churches,
each having originated from the organic
union of two or more churches,
or having been established as a “union”
church in a community possessing no
church, but containing families of various
denominational connections in the
past. The union church once formed
usually stands alone, without any denominational
affiliation.</p>

<p>Then there is the regular “denominational”
church, which either just happens
to be or has come purposely to be
the only church in the community; and
which makes the boast of existing for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>the whole community rather than for
its particular denominational group.</p>

<p>And there are other varieties, which
could indeed be dignified into types, if
we were pushed to it. The important
thing, however, is that out of a general
unrest and dissatisfaction with churches
that aim to keep breeding up within
themselves a highly pedigreed group of
personalities which possess decidedly
exclusive, if not aristocratic, characteristics,
have arisen overnight, as it were,
churches which admit to the inner circle
all the pedigrees and aim at the democratic
ideal of acting in the realm of
religion for the last man, woman, and
child in the community.</p>


<p><i>Churches for the Whomsoever</i></p>

<p>Here we have before our very eyes,
then, a kind of a church which is run,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>as President Van Hise said his university
was run, not for a select few
within its walls, but for the whomsoever
within its own territory; a church that
views every single member as a “carrier”
of the goods of life to the last
man, rather than as a precious mechanism
in which should be lodged all the
mysteries of a peculiar cult.</p>

<p>Look over some of the stories of
these churches which are confessedly
trying to find their way to a new expression
of social religion designed to
prevent the wastes of competitive
Christianity.</p>

<p>Here are the high points in an Idaho
community church: Rural, in a town
of 600 souls. Presbyterian by connection,
but with members formerly
of sixteen different denominations.
Membership, 400. Plant worth $50,000,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>with eighteen separate class-rooms
for Sunday-school use. A community
house, with gymnasium. Rest room
for women and girls. A week-day
church school using one hour a week
of school time. In summer, a daily vacation
Bible school. A Boy Scout
troop. A Campfire Girls’ organization.
Potato growers and fruit men
freely using the community hall.
High moral standards reflecting the
unity of the people.</p>

<p>Take another community church
of farmers in Iowa, in the open country:
An architecturally commanding
building, providing, like a well-organized
school-house, many separate rooms
for religious instruction. The church
has deliberately packed into its conception
of “community church” the idea
that, assuming Christianity to have contact
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>with every phase of living, the
church has responsibility for providing
the auspices under which all social activities
of the community take place.
What more natural, then, than that the
Fourth of July celebration should be
around the most beautiful spot in the
community, the church? Farmers’
Institute in the church? Young people
having a place for good times at the
church? A church committee looking
after the matter of bringing good families
on to farms that are for sale or
rent in the community?</p>

<p>Take a certain community church in
Indiana. Here is the story of an honest
struggle on the part of four church
pedigrees to burn their bridges behind
them, and, pooling their resources, to
start in anew. The peculiar traditions
of each cult, however, cling desperately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>to each group, until, after trying in vain
to carry these psychological contradictions
along in an artificial unity, in a
moment of supreme devotion to the
good of their community, they strip off
their trade-marks, forget their shibboleths,
and step forward into religious
freedom.</p>

<p>The community-church movement is
not going to create, I surmise, new
sects, leaving a residuum of several
more denominations. Rather it is a
real step towards the organic union of
kindred church bodies on the one hand,
and so a reduction of sects; and on the
other hand, a step towards democratizing
every church and making it a real
community church.</p>


<p><i>The Rural Dilemma and the Way Out</i></p>

<p>It will require only another thousand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>of these brave, venturesome community
churches to turn every select-bodied
denomination to looking itself over.
This self-criticism will lead the great
Protestant church bodies, let us hope,
to a church conscience in regard to
destructive church competition. Then
it will be an easy step to coming to
terms with one another in any locality,
so as to give the community a chance to
have a community church.</p>

<p>The community church, if we can
have any faith in mankind, is sure to
come along strong. If high officials
become obstructionists, they will be
swept away; for the people, when they
once clearly see, will have their way in
churches and religion as in the long run
they do in government and politics.</p>

<p>The sooner the great Protestant
bodies confess their sins of competition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>and put their houses in order, the
sooner the new day will come for the
remote community and the last man.</p>

<p>Some of us know what it is to be
a devotee of a great church sect. The
absolute rightness of our cult has been
no more questionable than our own existence.
When our sect was in parallel
columns with any other religious
sect, we did not, could not yield right
of way.</p>

<p>But when we are all consciously confronted
with the problem of working
out the religious life of 30,000,000 of
isolated farm people, we wake up to
the fact that we occupy a position
where cult pride, cult individualism,
and cult exclusiveness break down.
Then we find ourselves in a dilemma;
we must leave the farmers to rot, a
thing which is unquestionably abhorrent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>to our cult; or we must modify
our cult, a thing which on the surface
seems a sacrilege to do.</p>

<p>But there is a way out of every
dilemma; generally, however at the
cost of a bit of human pride. The community
church shows the various noble
church cults one way out of the rural
church dilemma.</p>

<p>Read these bold words from a group
of fifty young Methodist rural workers
penned to bishops:</p>

<p>“To the Bishops of the Methodist
Episcopal Church: We the undersigned
members of the Methodist
Episcopal Church appeal to you to
give prayerful consideration to the
following suggestions:</p>

<p>1. That the bishops, district superintendents,
and other administrative
officers of our denomination cordially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>coöperate with the leaders of other denominations
in an effort to so organize
rural church geographical units that
not more than one Protestant church
to every one thousand population shall
prevail as a standard.</p>

<p>2. That service to the community
rather than to the denomination be the
basis on which ministers shall be
trained, appointed, and promoted.</p>

<p>3. That the Methodist Episcopal
Church take the lead in the give-and-take
method with other denominations,
even to the extent of
encouraging the discontinuance of
small, struggling, competing Methodist
churches in the interest of rural
Christian service to the communities
involved.</p>

<p>4. That zeal for service to the entire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>community and a sympathetic consideration
for those whose background
and training are non-Methodist shall
characterize the efforts of the Methodist
Episcopal Church wherever it alone
occupies a rural field.</p>

<p>5. That the conference membership
of a Methodist Episcopal minister
shall not be jeopardized by appointment
as pastor of a federated or undenominational
church where such a
church is required for the largest service
to the community.”</p>

<p>Theological students and college
students are not to be outdone by their
elders in bravery. Read the following
document for circulation among the
officials of the various church bodies—a
document which sounds like the “first
call” for the rural community church:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>
<p>“We the rural college student delegates
at the American Country Life
Association Student Conference believe
that the minister who serves in a church
which has no right to exist loses respect
for his profession and can not do outstanding
work; we believe that our
denominational boards which appropriate
money we give to keep churches
going in overchurched communities and
which send leadership into such communities
are only making people feel
that the ideals of Christianity are no
higher than those of pagan religions.
We would apply the principles and
teachings of Jesus Christ. Therefore
we recommend:</p>

<p>1. That students preparing to enter
the rural ministry refuse to serve
charges in overchurched communities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>
<p>2. That we, as rural students, do all
in our power in our communities and in
places of leadership that we may attain
to prevent denominational church
boards from pouring money and leadership
into communities, which is to be
used to perpetuate denominational
strife that is destroying the religious
life of our communities.</p>

<p>3. That we pledge ourselves to endeavor
to substitute the principles and
teachings of Jesus Christ for narrow
denominational creeds and doctrines.
In view of this, we shall try to obtain
an atmosphere and physical equipment
of rural churches, as well as church
services themselves, that shall be designed
to meet the physical, social, mental,
and spiritual needs of the people
who worship there, regardless of their
denominations.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>
<p>The press carries the story that
down in Georgia five hundred farmers
last season dedicated an acre of land
apiece, with all it grew, to the Lord.
These pieces of land are spoken of
generally in Georgia as the “Lord’s
Acres,” and the “Lord’s Acre Plan”
is hailed as a hundred per cent. way to
finance the country church.</p>

<p>The story goes on to say:</p>

<p>“Farmers in the South are firmly
convinced that the Lord’s Acre yields
better crops than surrounding land,
and that the entire farm of the one
giving the acre is more productive than
those of his neighbors.”</p>


<p><i>The Community Church as a Democracy</i></p>

<p>The community church strikes me as
a Lord’s Acre in rural Christendom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>bearing a crop dedicated to God.
And, if I read the returns aright, the
comparative yield justifies the belief.
It is a church of the people—a democracy
in very truth. Any subtle influence
that would tend to wash in upon
this democracy and wear it down to a
dominating set of people or to a group
of negligible folk or to a loose aggregation
of nondescripts must be walled
off with reinforced concrete.</p>

<p>A single type of religious temperament
will not govern the range and
character of the community church.
A constant sort of ideals that appeals
only to the seraphic souls or to other
minds only in moments of exalted pitch
will, by a natural process of elimination,
soon reduce the church to a temperamental
sect. No, the church is made
up of all temperaments: the matter-of-fact,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>active, and practical; the poetic,
sentimental, imaginative; the strenuous;
the easy-going; the enthusiastic;
the petty; the anxious; the
generous, self-denying; the jolly,
optimistic; the gloomy, conservative;
the militant, crusading; the important;
the retiring. Their interests, too—the
interests of the whole church are
as broad and various as human nature.</p>

<p>A cross-section of Christianity will
reveal a ten-thousand fold variegation
of human streak and human color
wherever religion has filtered into
actual life. This meeting-ground of
all the higher interests of the community
will, therefore, be home for each interest.
As no single type of temperament
should repulse the others and shrink the
church, so no single activity of the
church should monopolize the focus of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>attention. The mission interest, the
Bible interest, the educational interest,
the interests social, musical, ceremonial,
disciplinary, the evangelistic interest,
the civic and industrial interest, the
financial interest, the idealistic interest,
both personal and social—all these
and the rest will have good footing in
the community church.</p>

<p>A church which should undertake to
be a democracy in fact would find that
there is only one way of “maintaining
interest” enough actually to keep bringing
the people together. This way is
sounding God’s summons to keep going
the redemption of its community at
every point. The summons to definite
undertakings to improve community
life is like the summons to a pioneer
homesteader to make a home fit for his
family. He gears his hands to ax and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>saw, to plow and hammer, and he knows
that he can change the wilderness.</p>

<p>Besides stereotyped church procedure,
a steady look at living conditions
in the community, with the determined
expectation of changing these
conditions for the better; a look for the
moral clues to whole wretched situations;
a look to disentangle from the
chaotic mass single, great, unmistakeable
moral issues—these steady looks,
under God’s summons, must be given
anew in every generation to the
kaleidoscopic facts of human life.</p>

<p>The church that shall go into the business
of becoming self-conscious and of
realizing its democracy will hear God’s
summons to community redemption
and begin to re-scale the map of church
importance and usefulness in the community
on heroic lines.</p>
